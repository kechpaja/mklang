I am going to stop writing code, and start writing design stuff in this file. 

First off, we need to figure out how the phonology of a particular language is
going to be stored. The original idea that I had in my head was to put
everything into a chart from the very beginning, and force the user to add
rows and columns (for POA and MOA), and then edit the individual cells to
handle voicing, aspiration, and any other contrasts that might appear. Of
course, we'd need to put nasalization into the rows, since nasals usally form
their own MOA for all intents and purposes. 

However, there might be a better way. I've got to think of what it is, though.
